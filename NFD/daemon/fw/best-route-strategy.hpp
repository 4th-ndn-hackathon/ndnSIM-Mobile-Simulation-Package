/** \brief Best Route strategy version 1
 *
 *  This strategy forwards a new Interest to the lowest-cost nexthop
 *  that is not same as the downstream, and does not violate scope.
 *  Subsequent similar Interests or consumer retransmissions are suppressed
 *  until after InterestLifetime expiry.
 *
 *  \deprecated This strategy is superceded by Best Route strategy version 2,
 *              which allows consumer retransmissions. This version is kept for
 *              comparison purposes and is not recommended for general usage.
