 * @brief Output to stream with specified indent or prefix
 *
 * For example, the following code:
 *
 *     std::cout << "Hello" << std::endl;
 *     IndentedStream os1(std::cout, " [prefix] ");
 *     os1 << "," << "\n";
 *     {
 *       IndentedStream os2(os1, " [another prefix] ");
 *       os2 << "World!" << "\n";
 *     }
 *     // either os1 needs to go out of scope or call os1.flush()
 *
 * Will produce the following output:
 *
 *     Hello
 *      [prefix] ,
 *      [prefix] [another prefix] World!
